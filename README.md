# Win10BSFixer

A repository for fixing various nasty things about Windows 10.
Fow now, the main feature is that it allows you to FULLY disable windows updates.
Runs as a small program that lives in your system tray. A product of frustration.

Added features:
- Fully disable Windows updates
- Run windows updates manually at a time of your choosing

Roadmap:
- Nagging you to install updates (but NEVER forcing one)
- Various efforts at disabling telemetry
- Remove crapware (Onedrive, the crappy social games, start menu ads etc)
